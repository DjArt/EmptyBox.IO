# EmptyBox.IO
Cross-Platform IO Library
That is library for unification of code for all supported platforms. With this library, all code, associated with IO operations, can be written in one shared library, and you shouldn't think about porting it to another platform.
## Development state
**Library in alpha state.**
At now, active developmet platforms is UWP and usual Windows apps. Next platforms at priority is Linux and Android. Of course, you can help me with any platform, not looking at priority.
## How to use
See [How to use library](https://github.com/DjArt/EmptyBox.IO/wiki/How-to-use-library) article.
